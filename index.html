        <h2>What&nbsp;it&nbsp;is, why&nbsp;it's&nbsp;bad:</h2>
        <p>
            Transmedicalists (or <span class="i">transmed</span>, <span class="i">truscum</span>) 
            are fundamentally people, typically transgender, who wish to emphasize 
            the medical aspects of trans people and/or gender non-conformity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transmeds organized against the increasing rates of transgender people in the late 2010s.
            They believe the new wave of transgender people invalidate their status as transgender.
            They hold that the majority of transgender claimants are identifying as such purely for their social benefit,
            that the "new wave" is not genuinely transgender. 
            Transmeds possess a very static view of what makes a woman and what makes a man. 
            Should you violate that, you become their enemy.

            They consider these pretenders (or <span class="i">transtrenders</span>, <span class="i">tucutes</span>) to be antithetical to their acceptance.
            Rather than see those in the "new wave" as allies, they see them as the problem, 
            claiming <span class="i">they</span> are the reason transgender people are not taken seriously. 
            They see the "trenders" as the thieves of their medicine and the drivers of their oppression.
            While the influx of oppressive laws in response of the "new wave", 
            that is not the fault of those who have newly remained themselves. 
            Such actions against trans people were inevitable when the number of those 
            willing to consider their human nature hit the threshold.<br>

            Say, ten years ago, Capitol Hill catches wind of the increasing numbers of gay people, 
            using their legislative powers to deprive people of who they would overwise find themselves to be. 
            As a gay person, it would be absurd to blame the "new" gay people. 
            They didn't cause this, it was a natural result of increasingly widespread self-reflection.
            <br><br>
            <span class="b">Why should it now be different?</span>
        </p>

            Personally, I think these people just want to feel special &mdash; 
            they view their transgender identity as an invite-only club for 
            the cool kids only. An influx of people challenges that, so they 
            exclude the "invaders". It's a similar principal to keeping an 
            indie artist to one's self to ensure they stay cool, 
            but with a subject matter far more extreme.

            that would only make their life harder.
